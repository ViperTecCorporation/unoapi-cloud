# How the API works

These five concepts explain the message path without requiring knowledge of the
internal implementation.

## 1. A session is one connected account

The `{phone}` route value identifies the session carrying traffic; it is not the
message recipient.

```http
POST /v15.0/{session}/messages
```

- `{session}` is the connected account;
- `to` is the destination conversation;
- `version` preserves the HTTP contract version.

## 2. The token authenticates the installation

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

Never place tokens in query strings, logs or public examples. The
[interactive API](/en/api-reference) lets you edit the URL and token locally.

## 3. One person may have multiple identity forms

The phone number is useful for display and compatibility. When available,
`user_id` is the canonical identity. `username` is an optional alias.

```json
{
  "to": "15557654321",
  "user_id": "273877414502425@lid",
  "username": "maria",
  "type": "text",
  "text": { "body": "Hello" }
}
```

Resolution prefers a valid `user_id`, then the local identity cache, then a
network lookup only when needed. See [Identities and contacts](/en/guide/contacts).

## 4. Request acceptance and delivery are different moments

HTTP `200` from `/messages` means the request was accepted. Final state arrives
asynchronously in the webhook.

| Moment | Observe | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| accepted | HTTP response | valid payload and send started |
| sent | `statuses[].status = sent` | message published |
| delivered | `delivered` | destination device received it |
| read or played | `read` or `played` | recipient confirmation |
| failed | `failed` with `errors[]` | final error to record |

Store the returned ID and correlate later status events with it.

## 5. Media has a source, persistence and download path

Use exactly one outgoing source: `link`, `id` or the ViperConnect `base64`
extension. For persisted incoming media, webhooks keep both `id` and `url` for
compatibility. New consumers should prefer the ID and the API download route
instead of coupling directly to a storage bucket.

```text
HTTP client
   | authenticate, register and send
   v
ViperConnect API -> queue -> session worker -> network
   ^                                      |
   | normalized webhook                   | events and receipts
   +--------------------------------------+
```

Heavy work such as video preparation can run in a dedicated worker without
blocking regular messages. Valkey stores state and indexes; RabbitMQ transports
jobs and retries.

Core payloads follow a Cloud API-compatible shape. ViperConnect-only features
are marked as extensions and do not replace the existing URL or ID contracts.
Use guides to learn flows and the [interactive API](/en/api-reference) for exact
schemas and responses.
