# Docker Swarm

The Swarm templates keep persistent services on labeled nodes, use overlay
networks for internal traffic and publish telephony media ranges in host mode.

- [Download the Nginx/edge-proxy stack](/examples/docker-stack.unoapi-nginx.yml)
- [Download the Traefik stack](/examples/docker-stack.unoapi-traefik.yml)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://docs.yourdomain.com/examples/docker-stack.unoapi-nginx.yml \
  -o docker-stack.yml
chmod 600 docker-stack.yml
nano docker-stack.yml
docker stack config -c docker-stack.yml >/dev/null
docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml viperconnect
```

Review all placeholders before deploying. Label the node that owns persistent
data and telephony according to the constraints in the model. Local volumes do
not move with a task.

Valkey uses AOF with `appendfsync everysec`,
`no-appendfsync-on-rewrite no`, and the `save 3600 1` RDB safety snapshot. Port
6379 remains private to the overlay network and authentication is mandatory.

The generated stacks expose compact, non-overlapping RTP and WebRTC ranges.
Change the source templates and run `docs/examples/generate-swarm-stack.mjs`
instead of editing thousands of expanded port entries manually.
